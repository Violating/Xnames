    <h3>When an xbox live account goes unused for five years, Microsoft deletes the account and frees up the Gamertag for others to use. This web app, for the first time ever, alows you to see how close those Gamertags are to becoming available. It looks at the most recent activity associated with the Gamertag to determine how close it is to reaching the five year mark.</h3>
    <h1 style="text-align:center">How does it work?</h1>
    <h3>Enter in the Gamertag you would like to use and click Search Availability to see how long until it is available. You can also click Add to List to keep a list of your top Gamertag choices. Make sure to save the list for latter! Just load this webpage from the same device and your list will still be here waiting.</h3><br></div>
